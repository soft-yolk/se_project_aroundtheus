# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

- Intro
- Figma
- Images

**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Good luck and have fun!

#### Sprint 3 Progress

In this stage of the sprint, I've added a grid that that is responsive, along with some other elements like a header, footer, and a profile section. Some other features I have added are hover effects and text overflow.

#### Sprint 4 Progress

Sprint 4 covers Javascript, DOM, and GIT. This project uses Javascript to toggle our modal and allow text fields to be updated through forms. The elements of the page are now rendered via a template element.

#### Sprint 5 Progress

This sprint makes substantial progress by adding yet another modal that shows the larger image of each element, as well as a window to add a card to the library. The Javascript lessons cover interactivity using the DOM.
